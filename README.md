A simple and *feature light* file processor.

[!IMPORTANT]
> This tool was made to be small and portable and is not intended to be as
> feature-rich and as reliable as big preprocessors. It is lacks some important
> features such as proper error handling.
> Also, be aware that very little testing was performed and surely contains some
> bugs.
